# dhall-validator/action

This action uses [dhall-to-json](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-haskell/tree/master/dhall-json) to validate dhall files.

## Background

[@jsoref](https://github.com/jsoref) initially developed this for [@GarnerCorp](https://github.com/GarnerCorp),
and @GarnerCorp is sharing it as we think it might be useful to others.
